## Overview:
This Block Explorer would help you to check the block data on your DAppChain.

## Online explorer
You can just visit [Loom Block Explorer](https://loomx.io/developers/blockexplorer),
If you have a Loom DAppChain running on your local machine, you should see the block data there.

If you are running Loom DApp Chain on another machine, you can input your
Loom DApp Chain RPC server url into the bottom left corner of the list,
Normally the url should be `http://YOUR_DAPP_CHAIN_IP:46657`.


## Local Explorer
To get started with running a local Loom DAppChain  . clone the repo from our Github:

```
git clone https://github.com/loomnetwork/vue-block-explorer.git
```

Then install the dependencies and start the dev server:

```
yarn install
yarn run serve
```
